## Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Javi Rudolph (she/her)

I am a quantitative ecologist! Which means I like to play with models to understand nature. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on animal movement models with limited data.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m also currently working on building my [website](https://javirudolph.github.io/) with GitHub and quarto.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about boosted regression trees and deep neural networks.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a mom of three!
