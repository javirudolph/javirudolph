## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Javi Rudolph (she/her)

I am a quantitative ecologist! Which means I like to play with models to understand nature. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on animal movement models with limited data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about boosted regression trees and deep neural networks.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a mom of three - equally skilled at coding complex models and negotiating snacks.
